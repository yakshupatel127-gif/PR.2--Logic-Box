# PR.2--Logic-Box
# Logic Box Project

## Project Title

**Logic Box: Pattern Generator and Number Analyzer**

## Objective

The Logic Box project is a Python-based program designed to strengthen logical thinking and core programming skills. It focuses on:

* Control structures
* `for` and `while` loops
* The `range()` function
* Control statements (`break`, `continue`, `pass`)
* Nested loops for pattern generation

This project allows students to practice problem-solving and understand how loops and conditions work together in real programs.

## Features

### 1. Pattern Generator

* Generates patterns based on user input
* Uses **nested loops**
* Supports `for` and `while` loops
* Prompts the user to enter the number of rows
* Demonstrates row and column control using loops

#### Implemented Pattern

* Right-angled triangle

**Example Output (Rows = 5):**

```
*
**
***
****
*****
```

---

### 2. Number Analyzer

* Analyzes a range of numbers provided by the user
* Uses the `range()` function
* Iterates using a `for` loop

#### Operations Performed

* Checks whether each number is **Odd or Even**
* Calculates the **Sum of all numbers** in the given range

**Example:**

```
Start: 1
End: 5

1 is Odd
2 is Even
3 is Odd
4 is Even
5 is Odd

Sum = 15
```

## Control Statements

The program effectively uses:

* `break` to exit loops when required
* `continue` to skip iterations
* `pass` as a placeholder where logic may be added later

These help control the flow of execution within loops.

---

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* Basic understanding of loops and conditions

---

## How to Run the Program

1. Open a terminal or command prompt
2. Navigate to the project folder
3. Run the program using:

```bash
python logic_box.py
```

4. Follow the on-screen instructions
